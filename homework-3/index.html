        <h2>Sleeping</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes, the pace of modern life barely gives you time to stop and rest. It can make getting a good night’s sleep on a regular basis seem like a dream.

            But sleep is as important for good health as diet and exercise. Good sleep improves your brain performance, mood, and health.
            
            Not getting enough quality sleep regularly raises the risk of many diseases and disorders. These range from heart disease and stroke to obesity and dementia.
            
            There’s more to good sleep than just the hours spent in bed, says Dr. Marishka Brown, a sleep expert at NIH. “Healthy sleep encompasses three major things,” she explains. “One is how much sleep you get. Another is sleep quality—that you get uninterrupted and refreshing sleep. The last is a consistent sleep schedule.”
            
            People who work the night shift or irregular schedules may find getting quality sleep extra challenging. And times of great stress—like the current pandemic—can disrupt our normal sleep routines. But there are many things you can do to improve your sleep.
            
            Sleep for Repair

            Why do we need to sleep? People often think that sleep is just “down time,” when a tired brain gets to rest, says Dr. Maiken Nedergaard, who studies sleep at the University of Rochester.
            
            “But that’s wrong,” she says. While you sleep, your brain is working. For example, sleep helps prepare your brain to learn, remember, and create.
            
            Nedergaard and her colleagues discovered that the brain has a drainage system that removes toxins during sleep.
            
            “When we sleep, the brain totally changes function,” she explains. “It becomes almost like a kidney, removing waste from the system.”
            
            Her team found in mice that the drainage system removes some of the proteins linked with Alzheimer’s disease. These toxins were removed twice as fast from the brain during sleep.
            
            Everything from blood vessels to the immune system uses sleep as a time for repair, says Dr. Kenneth Wright, Jr., a sleep researcher at the University of Colorado.
            
            “There are certain repair processes that occur in the body mostly, or most effectively, during sleep,” he explains. “If you don’t get enough sleep, those processes are going to be disturbed.”
            
            Sleep Myths and Truths

            How much sleep you need changes with age. Experts recommend school-age children get at least nine hours a night and teens get between eight and 10. Most adults need at least seven hours or more of sleep each night.
            
            There are many misunderstandings about sleep. One is that adults need less sleep as they get older. This isn’t true. Older adults still need the same amount. But sleep quality can get worse as you age. Older adults are also more likely to take medications that interfere with sleep.
            
            Another sleep myth is that you can “catch up” on your days off. Researchers are finding that this largely isn’t the case.
            
            “If you have one bad night’s sleep and take a nap, or sleep longer the next night, that can benefit you,” says Wright. “But if you have a week’s worth of getting too little sleep, the weekend isn’t sufficient for you to catch up. That’s not a healthy behavior.”
            
            In a recent study, Wright and his team looked at people with consistently deficient sleep. They compared them to sleep-deprived people who got to sleep in on the weekend.
            
            Both groups of people gained weight with lack of sleep. Their bodies’ ability to control blood sugar levels also got worse. The weekend catch-up sleep didn’t help.
            
            On the flip side, more sleep isn’t always better, says Brown. For adults, “if you’re sleeping more than nine hours a night and you still don’t feel refreshed, there may be some underlying medical issue,” she explains.Sleep Disorders
            Some people have conditions that prevent them from getting enough quality sleep, no matter how hard they try. These problems are called sleep disorders.
            
            The most common sleep disorder is insomnia. “Insomnia is when you have repeated difficulty getting to sleep and/or staying asleep,” says Brown. This happens despite having the time to sleep and a proper sleep environment. It can make you feel tired or unrested during the day.
            
            Insomnia can be short-term, where people struggle to sleep for a few weeks or months. “Quite a few more people have been experiencing this during the pandemic,” Brown says. Long-term insomnia lasts for three months or longer.
            
            Sleep apnea is another common sleep disorder. In sleep apnea, the upper airway becomes blocked during sleep. This reduces or stops airflow, which wakes people up during the night. The condition can be dangerous. If untreated, it may lead to other health problems.
            
            If you regularly have problems sleeping, talk with your health care provider. They may have you keep a sleep diary to track your sleep for several weeks. They can also run tests, including sleep studies. These look for sleep disorders.
            
            Getting Better Sleep

            If you’re having trouble sleeping, hearing how important it is may be frustrating. But simple things can improve your odds of a good night’s sleep. See the Wise Choices box for tips to sleep better every day.
            

            Treatments are available for many common sleep disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help many people with insomnia get better sleep. Medications can also help some people.
            
            Many people with sleep apnea benefit from using a device called a CPAP machine. These machines keep the airway open so that you can breathe. Other treatments can include special mouthguards and lifestyle changes.
            
            For everyone, “as best you can, try to make sleep a priority,” 
            
            Brown says. “Sleep is not a throwaway thing—it’s a biological necessity.”

        <h2>Running</h2>
        <p>About running and jogging
            Jogging or running is a popular form of physical activity. About one in 5 Australians try running (or jogging) at some stage in their life. Running is an appealing exercise because it doesn't cost a lot to take part and you can run at any time that suits you.
            
            Some runners choose to participate in fun runs, athletics races or marathons. If you are interested in competing with other runners, contact your local running club.
            
            Health benefits of running and jogging
            Regular running or jogging offers many health benefits. Running can:
            
            help to build strong bones, as it is a weight bearing exercise
            strengthen muscles
            improve cardiovascular fitness
            burn plenty of kilojoules
            help maintain a healthy weight.
            An inactive lifestyle is associated with higher mortality, coronary artery disease, hypertension and stroke. It is also a primary cause of most chronic diseases, as the body rapidly adapts to insufficient physical activity which results in substantially reduced quality of life.
            
            Regular physical activity such as running can significantly improve mental health, self-confidence, healthy ageing, and quality of life.
            
            Running versus jogging


            The difference between running and jogging is intensity. Running is faster, uses more kilojoules and demands more effort from the heart, lungs and muscles than jogging. Running requires a higher level of overall fitness than jogging.
            
            Both running and jogging are forms of aerobic exercise. Aerobic means 'with oxygen' – the term 'aerobic exercise' means any physical activity that produces energy by combining oxygen with blood glucose or body fat.
            
            Goal setting for running and jogging

            Think about what you want to achieve from running or jogging. Issues to consider may include:
            
            Getting fit – if you're a beginner, you should start with brisk walking, progress to jogging and work up to running. This should take a few months.
            General fitness – mix your running with other forms of exercise (such as swimming or team sports) to maximise your overall fitness.
            Weight loss – adjust your diet to include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats, wholegrain cereals and low-fat dairy products. Cut back on dietary fats, takeaway foods, soft drinks and sugar.
            Companionship – you could run with a friend or join a local running club.
            Competition – running clubs may offer competitive events. Most clubs have sessions designed for beginners through to advanced runners. You can pit your running skills against others in fun runs or marathons. Many community-based running events cater for people of all ages and abilities. Join a local orienteering club to combine running with the challenge of navigating through various environments.
            Running and jogging for beginners
            Some general tips for beginners:
            
            See your doctor for a check-up before you start a running program. This is especially important if you are over 40 years, are overweight, have a chronic illness or haven't exercised in a long time.
            Pre-exercise screening is used to identify people with medical conditions that may put them at a higher risk of experiencing a health problem during physical activity. It is a filter or ‘safety net’ to help decide if the potential benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for you. Print a copy of the pre-exercise screening tool and discuss it with your doctor or exercise professional.
            Start with brisk walking. Aim for 30 minutes per session. Allow a minimum of 8 to 12 weeks to build up to regular running. Aim to increase your jogging time each session, and alternate between walking and jogging.
            Make sure you warm up and stretch thoroughly before you head out. Cool your body down with light stretches when you return.
            Make sure you have plenty of fluids and take a water bottle with you on your run. Try to drink plenty of water before, during and after any activity.
            Allow at least 2 complete rest days per week to avoid overtraining, which may cause injury. Consider other low impact activities, such as swimming, at least once each week.
            Plan your route. If possible, choose flat, grassy areas rather than hard or loose (such as sandy) surfaces to reduce the risk of injury.
            Avoid running near roads. This is especially important if you have a pre-existing condition such as asthma. Vehicle exhaust fumes can increase your risk of various cardiovascular and respiratory complaints or illnesses.
            Avoid the 'peak hour' periods to reduce your risk of inhaling air pollution from motor vehicles. If possible, schedule your runs for either the early morning or the evening.
            Wear clothing which wicks sweat away from the skin. Dress your upper body in layers of clothing so that you can take off layers as required.
            Apply SPF 50+ sunscreen to exposed skin areas.
            Buy an appropriate pair of shoes.
            Choosing running and jogging shoes
            Issues to consider when choosing running shoes include:
            
            Don't wear your old sneakers. Poorly fitted shoes are a common cause of injuries.
            The running shoe should bend easily, feel comfortable and have a wedge of shock-absorbing material in the heel.
            The fit should not be too snug. Your foot will splay as it impacts with the ground.
            When buying the shoes, wear the socks you intend to wear while running.
            Have your shoes professionally fitted.
            Attend your local running store to discuss the type of running shoe you want and previous shoes you have owned.
            It is important to get your shoe size measured.
            Try on multiple pairs of shoes for feel and comfort.
            Health and safety suggestions with running and jogging
            Suggestions include:
            
            Make sure you eat a healthy, well-balanced diet.
            Avoid eating directly before going for a run.
            Avoid running during the hottest part of the day in summer.
            Drink plenty of water before, during and after your run.
            Take your mobile phone with you.
            If using headphones, do not have the sound too loud – stay alert and aware.
            Wear reflective materials if you're running in the early morning or at night.
            Tell someone where you plan to run and when you think you'll be back.
            Choose well-lit, populated routes and avoid dangerous and isolated areas.
            If you injure yourself while running, stop immediately. 
            Seek medical advice.

        <h2>Healthy eating</h2>
        <p>Heart disease is the leading causeTrusted Source of death for adults in the United States, with an estimated 45 millionTrusted Source expected to have cardiovascular disease (CVD) by 2050.

            High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a form of CVD that can lead toTrusted Source:
            
            heart attack
            heart failure
            stroke
            The foods people eat can reduce their blood pressure and help keep their hearts healthy.
            
            The DASH diet, or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, includes plenty of heart-healthy foods. The program recommends:
            
            eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains
            choosing fat-free or low fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, and nuts
            limiting saturated and trans fat intake, such as fatty meats and full-fat dairy products
            limiting drinks and foods that contain added sugars
            restricting sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day — ideally 1,500 mg daily — and increasing consumption of potassium, magnesium, and calcium
            In addition to this, high fiber foods are crucial for keeping the heart healthy. The American Heart Association (AHA)Trusted Source states that dietary fiber helps improve blood cholesterol and lowers the risk of:
            
            heart disease
            stroke
            obesity
            type 2 diabetes
            Limiting certain types of fats can also improve heart health. For instance, eliminating trans fats reducesTrusted Source low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. This type of cholesterol causes plaque to collect within the arteries, increasing the risk of a heart attack and stroke.
            
            Reduced cancer risk
            The American Institute for Cancer Research recommends a diet rich in the following to support overall health and potentially reduce the risk of developing cancer:
            
            a variety of fruits and vegetables
            whole grains
            beans
            Some people believe that antioxidants in these foods play a key role in preventing cancer.
            
            However, according to the National Cancer InstituteTrusted Source, while laboratory and animal studies link certain antioxidants to a reduced incidence of free radical damage due to cancer, human trials remain inconclusive. Indeed, doctors advise against using these dietary supplements without consulting them first.
            
            Having obesity may increaseTrusted Source a person’s risk of developing cancer and result in less favorable outcomes. Maintaining a moderate weight may reduce these risks.

            Better mood
            Some evidence suggests a close relationship between diet and mood.
            
            According to a 2020 study, diet can affect several factors which, in turn, may impact a person’s mood. These include:
            
            blood glucose levels
            immune activation
            the gut microbiome
            The researchers also found that certain diets, such as the Mediterranean diet, may be linked to better mental health. The opposite is true for diets with high amounts of red meat, processed foods, and high fat foods.
            
            It is important to note that the researchers highlighted the need for further research into the mechanisms linking food and mental health.
            
            If a person suspects they have symptoms of depression, talking with a doctor or mental health professional may help.
            
            Improved gut health
            The colon is full of naturally occurring bacteria, which play an important role in metabolism and digestion.
            
            A diet high in fiber may decreaseTrusted Source inflammation in the gut. A diet rich in fibrous vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains may provide a combination of prebiotics and probiotics that help good bacteria thrive in the colon.
            
            These fermented foods are rich in probioticsTrusted Source:
            
            yogurt
            kimchi
            sauerkraut
            miso
            Prebiotics may help improve a range of digestive issues, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms.
            
            Improved memory
            A healthy diet may help maintain cognition and brain health. However, further conclusive research is necessary.
            
            A 2023 review concluded that micronutrients, including B vitamins, iron, and polyphenols, play an important role in supporting cognitive health.
            
            The following diets incorporate many of these elements and are associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia:
            
            Mediterranean diet
            Nordic diet
            DASH diet
            MIND diet
            Read more about foods to boost brain function here.
            
            Weight loss
            Maintaining a moderate weight can help reduce the risk of chronic health issues. A person who has more weight or obesity may be at risk of developing certain conditions, includingTrusted Source:
            
            coronary heart disease
            type 2 diabetes
            osteoarthritis
            stroke
            hypertension
            certain mental health conditions
            some cancers
            Many healthy foods, including vegetables, fruits, and beans, are lower in calories than most processed foods.
            
            A person can determine their calorie requirements using guidance from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020–2025Trusted Source.
            
            Maintaining a healthy diet can help people stay within their daily limits without monitoring their calorie intake.
